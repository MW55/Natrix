# Dereplication
derep:

        representative: most_common # Which sequence to use as a representative sequence per CDHIT cluster. longest = the longest sequence of the corresponding cluster, most_common = the most common sequence of the corresponding cluster.

# Chimera removal
chim:
        beta : 8.0 # Weight of a "no" vote for the VSEARCH chimera detection algorithm.
        pseudo_count : 1.2 # Pseudo - count prior on number of “no” votes.

        name_ext : R1 # The identifier for the forward read (for the reverse read the 1 is switched with 2, if the data is in paired-end format), has to be included at the end of the file name, before the file format identifier (including for single end files).

# BLAST
blast:
        blast : FALSE  # Boolean to indicate the use of the BLAST clustering algorithm to assign taxonomic information to the OTUs.
